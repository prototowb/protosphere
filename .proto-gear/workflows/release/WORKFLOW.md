# Release Workflow

## Overview

This workflow guides you through preparing, testing, and deploying a new software release from development to production. It covers versioning, changelog generation, testing, and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before starting release:
- ✅ All planned features for this release are completed and merged
- ✅ All tests are passing on development branch
- ✅ PROJECT_STATUS.md shows all tickets COMPLETED
- ✅ You have deployment permissions
- ✅ Release notes are ready or can be generated

## Release Types

### Major Release (X.0.0)
- Breaking changes
- Major new features
- Architectural changes
- Example: v1.0.0 → v2.0.0

### Minor Release (x.Y.0)
- New features (backward compatible)
- Enhancements
- Deprecations
- Example: v1.2.0 → v1.3.0

### Patch Release (x.y.Z)
- Bug fixes
- Security patches
- Minor improvements
- Example: v1.2.3 → v1.2.4

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Release

**Purpose**: Plan the release and verify readiness

**Process**:
1. Review PROJECT_STATUS.md for completed tickets
2. Verify all PRs are merged to development
3. Determine version number (semver)
4. Create release ticket
5. Communicate release plan to team

**Version Number Decision**:
```
Current: v1.2.3

Breaking changes? → v2.0.0 (Major)
New features?     → v1.3.0 (Minor)
Bug fixes only?   → v1.2.4 (Patch)
```

**Release Ticket Example**:
```markdown
## 🎫 Active Tickets

| ID | Title | Type | Status | Branch | Assignee |
|----|-------|------|--------|--------|----------|
| PROJ-100 | Release v1.3.0 | release | IN_PROGRESS | release/v1.3.0 | Release Manager |
```

**Release Checklist**:
- [ ] All planned features completed
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Dependencies updated
- [ ] Security scan passed

**Commands**:
```bash
# Check current version
cat package.json | grep version  # Node.js
cat pyproject.toml | grep version  # Python
git describe --tags --abbrev=0  # Git tags

# Verify development branch is clean
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git status

# Run tests
npm test  # Node.js
pytest    # Python
```

---

### Step 2: Create Release Branch

**Purpose**: Isolate release preparation from ongoing development

**Process**:
1. Checkout development branch
2. Pull latest changes
3. Create release branch
4. Verify branch creation

**Branch Naming**:
```
release/vX.Y.Z

Example: release/v1.3.0
```

**Commands**:
```bash
# Ensure on development branch
git checkout development
git pull origin development

# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.3.0

# Verify
git branch --show-current

# Push release branch
git push -u origin release/v1.3.0
```

**Why Release Branch?**
- Development can continue with new features
- Release branch stabilizes for testing
- Bug fixes go to release branch
- Branch merged to both main and development when done

---

### Step 3: Update Version Numbers

**Purpose**: Increment version across all project files

**Process**:
1. Update version in package/project files
2. Update version in documentation
3. Update version in code (if applicable)
4. Commit version bump

**Files to Update** (examples):
```bash
# Node.js
package.json → "version": "1.3.0"
package-lock.json → "version": "1.3.0"

# Python
pyproject.toml → version = "1.3.0"
setup.py → version="1.3.0"
src/__version__.py → __version__ = "1.3.0"

# Documentation
README.md → Installation instructions
docs/installation.md → Version references
```

**Example Version Bump** (Python):

**Before**:
```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "myproject"
version = "1.2.3"
```

**After**:
```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "myproject"
version = "1.3.0"
```

**Commit Version Bump**:
```bash
# Stage version changes
git add package.json package-lock.json README.md

# Commit
git commit -m "chore(release): bump version to 1.3.0"

# Push
git push origin release/v1.3.0
```

---

### Step 4: Generate Changelog

**Purpose**: Document all changes in this release

**Process**:
1. Review commits since last release
2. Categorize changes (features, fixes, breaking changes)
3. Write user-facing changelog
4. Update CHANGELOG.md

**Get Commits Since Last Release**:
```bash
# Get all commits since last tag
git log v1.2.3..HEAD --oneline

# Get conventional commits grouped by type
git log v1.2.3..HEAD --pretty=format:"%s" | grep "^feat:" | sort
git log v1.2.3..HEAD --pretty=format:"%s" | grep "^fix:" | sort
git log v1.2.3..HEAD --pretty=format:"%s" | grep "^BREAKING:" | sort
```

**Changelog Template**:
```markdown

### Step 5: Run Full Test Suite

**Purpose**: Verify all functionality works before release

**Process**:
1. Run unit tests
2. Run integration tests
3. Run end-to-end tests
4. Check code coverage
5. Run security scans
6. Fix any failing tests

**Testing Commands**:
```bash
# Unit tests
npm test                    # Node.js
pytest tests/unit/          # Python

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration    # Node.js
pytest tests/integration/   # Python

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e           # Node.js
pytest tests/e2e/          # Python

# Coverage
npm run test:coverage      # Node.js
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html  # Python

pip-audit                  # Python
bandit -r src/             # Python security
```

**Coverage Requirements**:
```
Minimum acceptable: 70%
Target: 80%+
Critical paths: 100%
```

**If Tests Fail**:
1. Fix the bugs (create bugfix branch from release)
2. Merge fixes back to release branch
3. Re-run tests
4. Don't release until all tests pass

## Versioning Guidelines

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

**Format**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.3.0)

**MAJOR** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0):
- Breaking changes
- Remove/rename public APIs
- Change behavior of existing features
- Require users to update their code

**MINOR** (1.2.0 → 1.3.0):
- New features (backward compatible)
- Deprecate functionality (but don't remove)
- Enhancements to existing features
- Users can upgrade without code changes

**PATCH** (1.2.3 → 1.2.4):
- Bug fixes
- Security patches
- Performance improvements
- No new features or breaking changes

### Pre-Release Versions

**Alpha** (v1.3.0-alpha.1):
- Early testing
- Unstable
- Features may change

**Beta** (v1.3.0-beta.1):
- Feature complete
- Testing phase
- Minor changes possible

**Release Candidate** (v1.3.0-rc.1):
- Final testing
- No new features
- Only critical bug fixes

**Example Flow**:
```
v1.3.0-alpha.1 → v1.3.0-alpha.2 → v1.3.0-beta.1 → v1.3.0-rc.1 → v1.3.0
```

---

## Release Cadence

### Time-Based Releases
- **Weekly**: Patch releases (bug fixes)
- **Bi-weekly/Monthly**: Minor releases (features)
- **Quarterly/Annually**: Major releases (breaking changes)

### Feature-Based Releases
- Release when significant features are ready
- Minimum 1-2 weeks between releases
- Emergency hotfixes as needed

### Continuous Deployment
- Merge to main = automatic deployment
- Feature flags control visibility
- Gradual rollouts (10% → 50% → 100%)

---

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Skipping Staging

**Bad**: Deploy directly to production

**Good**: Always test in staging first

### ❌ Incomplete Testing

**Bad**: "Tests probably pass, let's ship"

**Good**: Run full test suite and verify results

### ❌ Poor Release Notes

**Bad**: "Bug fixes and improvements"

**Good**: Detailed changelog with links to issues

### ❌ Not Monitoring Post-Deploy

**Bad**: Deploy and walk away

**Good**: Monitor for 1-2 hours after deployment

### ❌ Forgetting to Merge Back

**Bad**: Release branch merged to main only

**Good**: Merge to both main AND development

---

## Rollback Procedure

If release has critical issues:

1. **Assess Impact**
   - How many users affected?
   - Data loss/corruption?
   - Workaround available?

2. **Decide: Hotfix or Rollback**
   - Quick fix (30 min)? → Hotfix
   - Complex issue? → Rollback

3. **Execute Rollback**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-production.sh v1.2.3  # Previous version
   ```

4. **Communicate**
   - Notify users of rollback
   - Explain issue
   - Provide timeline for fix

5. **Fix and Re-Release**
   - Create hotfix branch
   - Fix the issue
   - Test thoroughly
   - Deploy as v1.3.1

---

## Success Criteria

A release is successful when:

- ✅ Deployed to production without issues
- ✅ All features working as expected
- ✅ No increase in error rates
- ✅ Performance metrics acceptable
- ✅ User feedback positive
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Team notified
