## How to Use Workflows

Workflows provide step-by-step guidance for accomplishing larger, multi-step tasks.

### For AI Agents

1. **Identify your task type** - Is it a feature, bug fix, refactoring, etc.?
2. **Find matching workflow** - Use trigger keywords to find the right workflow
3. **Check dependencies** - Ensure required skills/commands are available
4. **Follow step-by-step** - Execute each step in order
5. **Use native tools** - git, pytest, npm, etc. as described

### Workflow Structure

Each workflow contains:
- **Prerequisites** - What must be true before starting
- **Step-by-step process** - Numbered, actionable steps
- **Success criteria** - How to know you're done
- **Common pitfalls** - Mistakes to avoid
- **Related capabilities** - Links to relevant skills/commands

### Example: Using Feature Development Workflow

```
Task: Add user login feature

1. Read workflows/feature-development.md
2. Step 1: Create ticket in PROJECT_STATUS.md
3. Step 2: Create feature branch
4. Step 3: Write failing tests (RED)
5. Step 4: Implement feature (GREEN)
6. Step 5: Refactor code
7. Step 6: Commit changes
8. Step 7: Create pull request
```

## Workflow Decision Tree

**Choose the right workflow for your task:**

```
What are you working on?

├─ New functionality → feature-development.md
├─ Fixing a bug → bug-fix.md
├─ Critical production issue → hotfix.md
├─ Production incident/outage → incident-response/WORKFLOW.md
├─ Code review / PR → code-review-process/WORKFLOW.md
├─ Breaking change / data migration → migration/WORKFLOW.md
├─ Ready to release → release.md
├─ Just pushed a release tag → finalize-release.md
├─ Improving code structure → refactoring.md (if available)
├─ Making code faster → performance-optimization.md (if available)
└─ Other tasks → Check commands/ for single-action patterns
```

## Adding Custom Workflows

To add a new workflow to this project:

1. Create file: `workflows/your-workflow-name.md`
2. Add YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: "Your Workflow Name"
   type: "workflow"
   version: "1.0.0"
   description: "Brief description"
   tags: ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
   category: "development"
   relevance:
     - trigger: "keywords that suggest this workflow"
     - context: "when to use this workflow"
   dependencies: ["skills/testing"]
   steps: 5
   estimated_duration: "1-2 hours"
   status: "stable"
   ---
   ```
3. Write numbered steps with clear instructions
4. Include prerequisites, success criteria, and common pitfalls
5. Update this INDEX.md to list your new workflow
